Create Chapter Recording
========

After the verse or chunk recordings have been created for a chapter it is then possible to make a recording into a complete chapter. The translator can listen to the entire chapter and make additional edits if necessary.
 
**Terms to know**: 
 * Compile – to put into one piece, combine.
 * Stitch – to compile the different recordings into one recording.
 * Packaging - to prepare the recordings for compressing into a smaller file. This process is done automatically by the software.
 
Compile a Recording for the Chapter
-----
1. Start in the Project Management home screen and tap on the book to finish. Notice that the circle should be full. The list of chapters for the book shows.

The chapters are listed – each one on a separate bar. 

**NOTE**:
 * The black stack of papers means that all verses/chunks have recordings.
 * The gray stack of papers means that there are missing recordings.

2. Tap on a bar to open a chapter. Notice full blue circle. 
3. Check to make sure there is only one recording for each chunk or verse.

**NOTE**: if there is no number next to the microphone, there is only 1 take per verse/chunk.

**NOTE**: When there are multiple takes per verse or chunk, there are rules for what take is included in the chapter recording. These are the rules followed when combing a chapter into a single audio file:

 * If there is a recording with a star rating, they are included according to the number of stars. 
 
   * 3 green stars = first choice; 2 yellow stars = second choice; 1 red star = third choice
   * If there is not a star rating given, then a green check mark is used.
 * If there are no star rating and the check is not green, then the most recent take is used.

4. Tap on the back arrow ←, found at the far left on the top blue bar, to return to the chapter listing.
5. Tap on the stack of paper icon to stitch the chapter into one file. A warning window opens asking "Compile all units into one chapter audio?"
6. Tap on OK to accept the action of making the chapter into a single file.

Repeat steps 2 – 6 for every chapter.

Check the Chapter Recording

**NOTE**: Chapters that have been stitched together have a number-inside-a-box icon and an arrow (>) icon on the chapter bar in Project Management.

**Listen to the Chapter Recording**

1. Tap on the right arrow (>) found at the right end of the chapter bar, to open the Take Bar for the chapter.
2. Tap on the green play icon to listen to a complete chapter. 

**Does the recording need editing?**
 * Are there long pauses?
 * Are there words that need to be corrected? 
 * Are there missing words?
 
 Make corrections to the verse or chunk recording:
 
 1. Tap on the chapter bar.
 2. Choose the verse or chunk that needs the new recording or editing. 
 3. Save the recording.
 4. Rate the best recording with a green star.
 5. Use the back arrow at the top to return to the Chapter list.
 
When the corrections have been made. Tap on the black stack of paper icon to stitch the chapter again.

NOTE: Each time a chapter is stitched – the new recording replaces the old chapter recording.

**Rate the Chapter Recording**

1. Tap on the number box to set a level of checking on the audio file.
2. Choose a rating by tapping on one of the numbers. 
 * 0 is the lowest rating while 3 is best rating.
3. Tap on the OK link to save the rating and close the window.
4. Tap on the back arrow in the top blue bar to return to the Project Management home screen.

When all the chapters are finalized (stitched) the book is done.

Chapters with gray colored stack of paper
------

1. Tap on the chapter bar with the gray colored stack of paper. Did you notice the partial blue circle? That indicates an incomplete chapter.
2. Find the verse or chunk that does not have a recording. 

**HINTS**: There is no arrow next to the microphone. The verse/chunk number is in gray.

3. Record the verse or chunk. Once the verse or chunk is done, then the chapter is ready to be combined into one audio file.
4. Tap the ← at the top to return to the chapter listing.
5. Tap the black stack of paper to stitch the chapter.

**REMEMBER**: Chapters with the number in a box icon are the chapters that have been stitched.
